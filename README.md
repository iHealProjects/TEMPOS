# Introduction
Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) describes a method of pain management where patients are given the ability to self-administer safe, fixed doses of analgesics via a PCA device. PCA devices (e.g. infusion pumps) are one of the most common methods of providing post-operative analgesia during patient recovery. Although the history of PCA is relatively short (in use since the 1970s), a substantial number of studies have been published concerning best practices for PCA use for a variety of clinical settings and medications. With the advent of digital computers, PCA devices have become even more user friendly and can provide physicians and researchers with records of a patient’s use of the PCA pump.  However, few—if any—studies exist discussing the retrieval or analysis of the data that these machines record. This report explores the potential benefits of looking at such data and the impact such investigation could have on patient pain management. Also, this document details current progress in the development of software to aid in PCA report visualization and analysis.

# Traditional Pain Management
Post-operative pain management via intramuscular (IM) opioids has been well documented with the traditional approach of nurses or physicians giving injections as needed resulting in 50% of patients receiving inadequate relief of pain [1]. The amount of opioid needed for effective analgesia varies from patient to patient and is identified by titrating opioid dosage until reaching a minimum effective analgesic concentration (MEAC) at which the patient has sufficient pain relief [2]. Plasma opioid concentrations are then measured and attempts are made to maintain opioid levels [2]. Maintaining MEAC, however, is difficult when using traditional IM injection due to variation in both dose frequency and the rate of opioid diffusion through muscle. PCA pumps are an effective tool for maintaining MEAC as they offer on-demand, intravenous (IV) injection of analgesics which reduces the time between injection and pain relief.
